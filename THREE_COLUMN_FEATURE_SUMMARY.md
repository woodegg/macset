# Three-Column File Pairs Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the three-column file pairs feature for the MACSet Processor. The feature extends the existing two-column format to support an optional third column containing a command to execute after successful file processing.

## Feature Description

### Format
- **Column 1**: Source file path (required)
- **Column 2**: Destination file path (required)  
- **Column 3**: Command to execute after processing (optional)

### Examples
```bash
# Two-column format (backward compatible)
source.txt|output.txt

# Three-column format with command
source.txt|output.txt|/etc/init.d/firewall restart

# Mixed format (some with commands, some without)
file1.txt|out1.txt,file2.txt|out2.txt|systemctl reload dnsmasq

# Complex command with arguments
source.txt|output.txt|echo 'Processing complete' && systemctl reload service
```

- Three-column format with failing command
- Mixed format (some with commands, some without)
- Complex command with arguments
- Empty command handling
- Monitor mode with commands

### 2. `demo_three_column_format.sh`

- Real-world examples with firewall and DNSMasq commands
- Mixed format usage
- Complex command execution

### 3. `run_test.sh`
Wrapper script for testing that sets proper environment variables to avoid permission issues.

### 4. `THREE_COLUMN_FEATURE_SUMMARY.md`
This summary document.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Backward Compatibility
- Existing two-column format continues to work unchanged
- No breaking changes to existing configurations

### 2. Command Execution
- Commands are executed after successful file processing
- Failed commands are logged but don't stop processing
- Empty commands are ignored gracefully

### 3. Error Handling
- Commands that fail are logged with error messages
- Processing continues even if commands fail
- Proper validation of command execution

### 4. Flexibility
- Support for simple commands and complex multi-command sequences
- Environment variable substitution in commands
- Support for both script files and inline commands

### 5. Monitoring Mode
- Commands are executed in both process and monitor modes
- Commands execute when files change in monitor mode
- Proper logging of command execution in both modes

## Testing

### Test Results
```
=== Test Results ===
Total tests: 7
Passed: 7
Failed: 0
All tests passed!
```

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Two-column format (backward compatibility)
- ✅ Three-column format with command
- ✅ Three-column format with failing command
- ✅ Mixed format (some with commands, some without)
- ✅ Complex command with arguments
- ✅ Empty command handling
- ✅ Monitor mode with commands

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Process file with command execution
./macset-processor.sh -p -F "source.txt|output.txt|/etc/init.d/firewall restart"

# Monitor mode with command
./macset-processor.sh -m -F "source.txt|output.txt|systemctl reload dnsmasq"
```

### Configuration File Usage
```bash
# In /etc/macset/config
FILE_PAIRS="/etc/network.txt|/var/output.txt|/etc/init.d/firewall restart,/etc/guest.txt|/tmp/guest_clean.txt"
```

### Complex Commands
```bash
# Multiple commands
./macset-processor.sh -p -F "source.txt|output.txt|echo 'Processing complete' && systemctl reload service"

# With environment variables
./macset-processor.sh -p -F "source.txt|output.txt|echo 'Processed at $(date)' >> /var/log/processing.log"
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Command Execution**: Commands are executed with the same privileges as the MACSet process
2. **Input Validation**: No additional input validation is performed on commands
3. **Logging**: All command executions are logged for audit purposes
4. **Error Handling**: Failed commands don't stop the processing pipeline

## Future Enhancements

1. **Command Timeout**: Add timeout mechanism for long-running commands
2. **Command Validation**: Add validation for allowed commands
3. **Conditional Execution**: Execute commands only under certain conditions
4. **Command Chaining**: Support for multiple commands per file pair
5. **Command Templates**: Support for command templates with variable substitution

## Conclusion

The three-column file pairs feature has been successfully implemented with full backward compatibility, comprehensive testing, and extensive documentation. The feature provides enhanced flexibility for integrating MACSet with other system services while maintaining the simplicity and reliability of the existing system.
